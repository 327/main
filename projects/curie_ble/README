Overview:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
curie_ble project implements the following functionalities:
1) A dummy cadence algorithm is added to sensor core running on ARC.
   It uses internal accelerometer data.
   It reports cadence every 5s when the device is moved.
2) BLE stack is enabled.
3) RSC BLE service is used to report stride length and computed cadence
   to the companion phone.

It implements a standard usage of the ble framework and sensor service.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get data from the cadence sensor and send this data over BLE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Start scanning the sensor with STEPCADENCE_TYPE_MASK bit masking
2) Subscribe to the sensor data with sensor handle, sampling and reporting
   intervals.
3) Collect the sensor data and report stride cadence through BLE RSC service.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected behavior
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Stride length and stride cadence come on the NRF master control android apk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to test and Verify
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Install NRF master control apk from Google play store
2) Scan for the available ble devices from companion device
3) Connect to your curie device. Check ble info with below commands
	a) Enter "ble info" on UART console, it will provides the address
           and GAP device name.
	b) Scan for the same device name and connect to it
4) Once connection is done, we can see Running and Speed Cadence and click on it
5) Click RSC measurement, it will start report the cadence and stride length.
6) Click again on the RSC measurement to unsubscribe sensor data, it stops
   reporting stride length, cadence and distance
7) Click on RSC measurement to restart and report the stride from zero

How to Compile the BLE project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project is built 'out of tree'.
First a build folder needs to be created (anywhere in the file-system).
Better not to create this folder inside source tree.

	mkdir out
	cd out
	make -f PATH_TO/wearable_device_sw/projects/curie_ble/Makefile setup
	make package
	make flash

make flash will be used for flashing the board. By default,
this file is located under "pub" in the OUT folder created above:

	PATH_TO_OUT_FOLDER/pub/device/curie_ble/image/curie_101/release/

The default location can be overridden by specifying the desired PUB path to
the "make package" command:

	make package PUB="/path/to/your/pub/folder"
